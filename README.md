# Celebrity-Look-alike-Model

The project can be generalised as a face recognition task. In the general facial recognition task, we expect the distance between oneâ€™s different photo representations to be a small value (based on a threshold value) to recognize a face. In this project, we ignore the threshold checking step. Instead, people who have a minimum distance score would be your celebrity look alike.
